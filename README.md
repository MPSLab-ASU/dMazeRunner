# dMazeRunner
dMazeRunner is a framework for automated and efficient search-space and design-space exploration for executing loop kernels on coarse-grained programmable dataflow accelerators. dMazeRunner employs analytical model of loop executions on dataflow accelerator architecture, helping guide search-space optimizations for mapping the loops. Through dMazeRunner, users can optimize dataflow acceleration of various ML models, analyze optimized mappings, and explore the mapping search-space and the design-space of accelerator architectures. 

### Please stay tuned for the code release.
