This document describes installing different dependencies for setting up dMazeRunner and TVM environment.

a) Download following dependencies [R1]:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-dev python3-setuptools gcc libtinfo-dev zlib1g-dev build-essential cmake


b) In building TVM, you will require configuring the build with LLVM [R1]. So, please follow instructions in [R1] about how to configure config.cmake for setting up the path to LLVM.

Once you successfully download and build LLVM, you will need to build TVM. For example,

cd </path/to/dMazeRunner/>
cd tvm
mkdir build
cp cmake/config.cmake build
cd build

Please edit your local config.cmake file in </path/to/dMazeRunner/tvm/build>, and set appropriate path for llvm-config as described in [R1].
For example, you may set 
set(USE_LLVM ON) or
set(USE_LLVM /home/username/llvm-project/build/bin/llvm-config)

Then, build TVM -
cmake ..
make -j2


c) Install additional dependencies specified in pip-dependencies.txt

pip3 install -r pip-dependencies.txt


d) Set appropriate paths for dMazeRunner and TVM modules. 

Edit ~/.bashrc and append the following at the bottom:

export DMZRNR_HOME=/path/to/dMazeRunner
export TVM_HOME=$DMZRNR_HOME/tvm
export PYTHONPATH=$DMZRNR_HOME/python:${PYTHONPATH}
export PYTHONPATH=$TVM_HOME/python:$TVM_HOME/topi/python:$TVM_HOME/nnvm/python:${PYTHONPATH}

Please note that dMazeRunner setup is successfully tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and 18.10 releases with a virtual-environment with python 3.6.8
If you are running dMazeRunner on a different environment, you may consider installing different versions of required tools and pip dependencies.
